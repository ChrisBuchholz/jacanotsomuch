## jacanotsomuch

This is my tweaked version of the [jacaetevha](https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish/tree/master/themes/jacaetevha)
theme that is distributed with oh-my-fish.

The only difference is that I have removed the directory size and the date
from the prompt so that it now only show user, host, directory and
(a bit more) git information.
